<p>The healthcare landscape is rapidly changing. From 2012 to 2016, physician 
    practices employed by hospitals increased by more than 100% with hospitals 
    acquiring 5,000 physician practices (Advocacy Institute Physicians 2018) and 
    by mid- 2016, roughly 42% of all physicians were employed in a hospital setting 
    (Advocacy Institute Physicians 2018). The push for various forms of vertical 
    integration  has been due to both pedagogical and political reasons. 
    Pedagogically, various health care groups believe that medical professionals 
    working together can reduce costs and increase patient outcomes (American Medical 
    Association 2020; Improving Chronic Illness Care 2020). Politically, vertical 
    integration has been heavily influenced through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) 
    which encourages doctors, hospitals, and health care providers to coordinate patient 
    care through the development of Accountable Care Organizations (ACO)  (Baker, Laurence C. and Kessler 2014) 
    Theoretically, vertical integration has the possibility to reduce costs by removing redundancy of medical 
    software and transaction costs associated with working independently. On the other hand, vertical 
    integration may increase costs to the healthcare system as large vertically integrated systems may 
    behave monopolistically and negotiate higher rates from insurers(Baker, Laurence C. and Kessler 2014; Capps, Dranove, and Ody 2018). 
    Research on the effectiveness of ACOs and vertical integration supports both theories, with 
    some studies showing that vertically integrated systems reduce costs and improve outcomes  (James and Savitz 2011), 
    and other studies showing vertical integration increases costs and does not change outcomes 
    (Koch, Wendling, and Wilson 2017).</p>
<b></b>
<p>When assessing the impact that vertical integration has on health outcomes, little is known about the effect vertical integration has had on prescribing rates by medical provider. 
    Prescription drugs are an important piece of the U.S. healthcare system, as an estimated 59% of U.S. adults report using a prescription medication from 2011 – 2012 (Kantor et al. 2015)
     and prescription drug use is increasing for all adult age groups (Center for Disease Control, 2016). Prescription drugs are a current topic within the U.S. political sphere, as congress
      is in the midst of proposing legislation to increase access to prescription drugs for Medicare Part D recipients (Sachs, 2019). In particular, opioid prescribing rates by practice 
      has been shown to be influenced by the specialty of practice (Ringwalt et al. 2014), with opioid prescribing rate varying by specialty (Rosenkrantz et al. 2018; Chen JH, Humphreys K, Shah NH 2016). 
      This study is at the intersection of vertical integration and prescribing rates by medical provider. We believe that through the spillover effects  of vertical integration, 
      medical prescribing rates will be influenced. </p>
<b></b>
<p>Our analysis uses cross-sectional data of Medicare medical providers across the U.S. for 2016 which includes opioid prescribing rates, provider specialty, and county-level characteristic data. 
    We select opioid prescriptions as they are both well documented and used across a variety of specialties. While opioids are used across many specialties, they are not used 
    across all specialties, thus creating a selection problem for study. To account for this, we use a statistical model that accommodates this type of selection issue  and find that
    prescribing rates across specialties decrease when incorporating vertical integration. We hypothesize that the spillover effects of practicing in environments of varied specialties 
    makes prescribing patterns a weighted average of all specialties a provider interacts with.</p>
<b></b>
<p>We use publicly available data from CMS’ Medicare Part D Prescription and Physician Compare data to pull opioid prescribing rates by medical provider and determine if a medical provider 
    is in a vertically integrated health system, and the specialties within that system. We use the mix of specialties by group practice to determine if a provider is in a vertically integrated
     practice. However, we do not differentiate between sizes of vertically integrated practices .</p>
<b></b>
<p>We find consistent evidence that vertical integration influences opioid prescribing rates. To check the robustness of the results, we use a limited sample of only nurse practitioners 
    and find similar prescribing patterns. We use nurse practitioners as they are a flexible specialty that commonly works with a several specialties, but in certain areas, are also able
    to practice independently. We exploit this fact to compare nurse practitioners prescribing patterns when nurse practitioners work independently with other nurse practitioners who work 
    with multiple specialties. </p>
