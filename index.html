      Recent literature suggests that opioid prescription intensity may vary by provider type. However, with the rapid consolidation of healthcare providers into large vertically integrated practices, research has not investigated the prescribing differences of providers as they are integrated into practices. Using data from CMS Physician Compare, U.S. health care providers are linked into distinct practices, which are then defined as either primary care, specialty, multispecialty, pain management, and independent nurse practitioner practices. These practice designations are then linked to the individual health care providers in the CMS Part D prescriber file. After controlling for a large number of individual provider and provider catchment area population covariates, we use a multivariate two-stage selection regression model and estimate the effects of both provider type and provider practice type on two outcomes, the number of opioid prescriptions and normalized opioid days supplied. We find that compared to primary care providers, the quantity of scripts and days ordered increase with each provider type in the following order: nurse practitioners, specialists, and pain management. Providers in multispecialty practices were found to order opioids at a rate in between primary care and specialty only practices. After restricting the sample to nurse practitioners, we find no significant difference in opioid ordering between independent nurse practitioners and those practicing in primary care practices. However, nurse practitioners practicing in multi-specialty and specialty-only practices, were found to order at increasingly higher rates, respectively. These results indicate that the practice environment may matter as much as specialty type in opioid prescription decisions.
